# Introduction

The Crypto3.Codec library extends the Nil Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set of encoding algorithms implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features
support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.
 
Crypto3.Codec consists of several parts to review:
* Algorithms.
* Architecture.
* Concepts.
* Interface.

A small part of each topic is reviewed right at introduction, but the detailed information is recommended to look inside of a corresponding chapter.

## Algorithms

Crypto3.Codec library contains following encoders:

* Base-family (Base32, Base58, Base64)
* Hex encoding

## Architecture

Crypto3.Codec library is implemented in several parts:
