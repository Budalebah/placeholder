# Hash Introduction # {#hashes_introduction}

The Crypto3.Hash library extends the Nil Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set of hashes 
 implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.
 
Crypto3.Hash consists of several parts to review:
* [Manual](@ref hashes_manual).
* [Implementation](@ref hashes_impl).
* [Concepts](@ref hashes_concepts).
