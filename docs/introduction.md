# Introduction

The Crypto3.Stream library extends the Nil Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set of stream ciphers
 implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features
  support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.
  
  Crypto3.Stream consists of several parts to review:
  * Algorithms.
  * Architecture.
  * Concepts.
  * Interface.
  
  A small part of each topic is reviewed right at introduction, but the detailed information is recommended to look
   inside of a corresponding chapter.
   
## Algorithms

Crypto3.Stream library contains following block ciphers:

* Chacha
* Salsa20
* RC4
