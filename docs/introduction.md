# Introduction

The Crypto3.Hash library extends the Nil Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set of hashes 
 implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.
 
 Crypto3.Hash consists of several parts to review:
  * Algorithms.
  * Architecture.
  * Concepts.
  * Interface.
