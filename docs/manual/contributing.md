### Contributing


We welcome contribution, bug reports, fixes and suggestions from the community.

### Branching guide

These branches are partially compliant to GitFlow branching model:
* `master` - contains tagged release versions.
* `develop` - contains in-development library state, used for feature-branching.
* `#version-branch` - contains changes related to particular version development.
* `#issue-branch` - contains changes related to particular issue.

The above nomenclature is followed for both mono repository and single module repositories.
