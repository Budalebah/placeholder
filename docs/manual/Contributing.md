### Branching guide

These branches are partially compliant to GitFlow branching model:
* `master` - contains tagged release versions.
* `develop` - contains in-development library state, used for feature-branching.
* `#version-branch` - contains changes related to particular version development.
* `#issue-branch` - contains changes related to particular issue.

The above nomenclature is followed for both super-repository and single module repositories.

Developers are required to fork the repository in question and submit a pull request targeting the `develop` branch.

### Opening Issues

Issues should be opened on the repository on github. Please await someone from the team to acknowledge it and add 
appropriate tag. See creating pull requests
